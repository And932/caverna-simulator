# Caverna Simulator
This project was inspired by the board game Caverna: The Cave Farmers by Uwe Rosenberg.<br>
It is create with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Game Idea
In this game, you take the role of adventurous dwarfs living reclusively in caves where you dig for ore and rubies and furnish caverns to become living and working areas. You need ore to craft weapons to undertake expeditions in search for adventure and loot. Rubies are a valuable and highly flexible good: you can trade them for other goods and landscape tiles at any time. Outside your caves, you will look after your sustenane by felling trees, raising farm animals and doing some agriculture.

At the end of the game, the wealthiest dwarf will win.
